# Project Vision: The Magic Mirror

We are creating a live, browser-based digital persona. A user opens a web page and sees an animated character that mirrors their expressions and movements in real-time.

## Core Experience
- **Instant On**: No installation required. The experience starts with a single click.
- **Effortless Connection**: The user's natural expressions instantly animate their digital self.
- **Personal and Expressive**: The goal is to capture the user's personality in the animation.

## Guiding Principles
- **Zero-Friction**: As easy as a video call.
- **Real-Time First**: Low latency is paramount.
- **Accessible**: Works on any modern computer with a webcam.
